# 🚀 Project 2: Multi-Page React Portfolio (Routing Implementation)

## 📝 Overview

This project is an extension of Project 1, transforming the single-page application into a **multi-page website** using client-side routing. [cite_start]The core objective was to implement a robust **Layout system** to share common UI elements across different routes using the `children` and `Outlet` concepts[cite: 24, 25, 27].

## ✨ Key Features

* [cite_start]**Multi-Page Structure:** The application is converted from a single page into a multi-page web site[cite: 25].
* [cite_start]**Layout System:** Developed using the `children` and `Outlet` features for consistent shared layouts[cite: 27].
* [cite_start]**Routing:** Utilizes the **`react-router-dom`** library for handling the multi-page system[cite: 26].

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Frontend:** React (JavaScript/JSX)
* [cite_start]**Routing:** `react-router-dom` [cite: 26]
* [cite_start]**Layout Management:** React Router's `Outlet` for nested routes [cite: 27]
