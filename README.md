# 🚀 Full-Stack Development Assignments

This repository contains various projects, focusing on modern full-stack web development practices. I utilize **React** for building interactive user interfaces and **NestJS** for robust, scalable API development.

Each project is located in its own directory (e.g., `Project-1`) and includes a dedicated `README.md` file detailing its features, requirements, and the specific technologies utilized.
